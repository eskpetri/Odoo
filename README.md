# Odoo
Diving into ERP system to learn how all comes into one system. Downside for me is that backend is done with python which I don't know that much. Upside is that frontend is done using javascript so there is lot to learn. From the perspective how frontend is server by backend. The presentation tier is a combination of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. The logic tier is exclusively written in Python, while the data tier only supports PostgreSQL as an RDBMS.

## Big cake ahead
