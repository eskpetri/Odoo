# Odoo
Diving into ERP system to learn how all comes into one system. Downside for me is that backend is done with python which I don't know that much. Upside is that frontend is done using javascript so there is lot to learn. From the perspective how frontend is server by backend. The presentation tier is a combination of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. The logic tier is exclusively written in Python, while the data tier only supports PostgreSQL as an RDBMS.

## Big cake ahead

As a developer I start with overall introduction from https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/howtos/rdtraining/01_architecture.html <br/>

OK too big cake almost choked on that one. Back to basic with javascript. Udemy or free cources on net. <br/>

https://odoo.github.io/owl/playground/ founded a bug and fixed it in ToDo List App (with reactivity). Reported it to source. Have to see when it is fixed.<br/>

Basicly Angural have higher learning curve at start but gives in the end on stability. React is faster to learn but you might go wrong. Have to test Angular and it gives you easy landing on React if it comes to that.
